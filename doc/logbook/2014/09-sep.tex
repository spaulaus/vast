\subsection{New Efficiency Curve}
I am now working with the efficiency curve from Sergey that has fixed errors in 
the light counting for the previous versions. I provided this data to Sergey 
from my 077cu.ban, Banana 4. These efficiency values are much more conservative
than the previous ones, since I had to taken into account a potential isomer
contaminent in the high energy (low ToF) side of things. 

The current issue is that he has only calculated the points for 1.5-5 MeV, as 
of 09-10-2014. I am assuming that he did this because those were the most 
relevant regions for Miguel's data. However, I require the 0.1 - 1 MeV region 
for my data. I have requested (today) that he perform the calculations for the 
lower energies. I feel that this is one of those prime exmaples where it would 
be nice for the rest of the collaboration to at least have access to the codes
that way I could run these things myself in a plug-and-play type application. 
For now, this means that all of my points below 1.5 MeV are extrapolations.

Well our first run with the new efficiency reports a negative P$_n$. This...
doesn't make too much sense. It was a misordering of the coefficients for 
the fit. They are defined inconsistently between the gnuplot script and the 
method in VAST.
