\subsection{Change Tack}
I am going to change my testing files from the \iso{Cu}{77} files to the 
\iso{Ga}{84} files. This way we can have a good comparison with Miguel's work
and confirm that there is nothing wrong with my codes. There is still this 
huge discrepancy with the \iso{Cu}{77,78} data that needs to be worked out and
I'm at the point where I really need to just confirm that my codes are doing 
what we think that they are doing. So let's get rolling.

\subsection{Update Eff Function}
We are going to need to make sure that we have the proper efficiency function 
from the simulation results here. I have been lazy with the efficiency 
calculator and have them all copy/pasted into the codes, so we should have it 
in there.

\subsection{Branching Ratio Calculation}
After revamping the EffCalculator, the B(GT) calculation has broken like a 
champ. Looks like I broke the Ge efficiency calculation. There was a unit error. 
I was trying to go from MeV to keV by dividing by 1000, this is dumb.

\subsection{P$_n$ for \iso{Ga}{84}}
I have got all the major errors that I can find fixed. This leaves us with the 
more complicated stuff. The P$_n$ for the \iso{Ga}{84} is being reported as 
40\%. This is significantly smaller than what Miguel reports, and what I have
gotten in the past. 

\textbf{The setup for this number is } with the ToF data taken using Miguel's 
banana, and the efficiency curve from Sergey using Miguel's banana. I have 
listed the current values for things in Table \ref{tbl:ga84-mmf-wrong}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    for the \iso{Ga}{84} data. The data use ToFs from Miguel's banana and 
    Sergey's efficiency from that banana.}
  \label{tbl:ga84-mmf-wrong}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Paramter & Value & Error\\\hline
      Integrated Yield & 2.662e5 & --\\\hline
      Number of Decays & 6.7503e5 & --\\\hline
      Pn & 0.39435 & 0.95527\\\hline
      Raw Number of Neutrons & 1011 & --\\\hline
      Raw Integrated Number of Neutrons & 1199.2 & --\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

I am double checking that I haven't screwed anything obvious up in my 
calculations. I need to really make sure that things are clean and easy to 
follow in terms of what they are doing. 

\textbf{UPDATE: } I have just gotten an email from Miguel saying that this number
that I am getting is consistent with what he is getting! This is good news. I 
am going to call that a win for now, and will talk with him more tomorrow.
