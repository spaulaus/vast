\subsection{Change Tack}
I am going to change my testing files from the \iso{Cu}{77} files to the 
\iso{Ga}{84} files. This way we can have a good comparison with Miguel's work
and confirm that there is nothing wrong with my codes. There is still this 
huge discrepancy with the \iso{Cu}{77,78} data that needs to be worked out and
I'm at the point where I really need to just confirm that my codes are doing 
what we think that they are doing. So let's get rolling.

\subsection{Update Eff Function}
We are going to need to make sure that we have the proper efficiency function 
from the simulation results here. I have been lazy with the efficiency 
calculator and have them all copy/pasted into the codes, so we should have it 
in there.

\subsection{Branching Ratio Calculation}
After revamping the EffCalculator, the B(GT) calculation has broken like a 
champ. Looks like I broke the Ge efficiency calculation. There was a unit error. 
I was trying to go from MeV to keV by dividing by 1000, this is dumb.
