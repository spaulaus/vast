Some prerequisites:

RooFit >= 3.55


1. SETTING UP 
   A) Directory structure:
      I have been using the following drectory structure: data, pics/tof, pics/vast, 
      results/tof, results/vast. These have been working pretty well for me but 
      that doesn't mean it works for you. The configuration file requires that 
      you put in path names into the files so that there is no need to have a set 
      directory structure. While this seems inflexable, the idea is that you're 
      going to have to think about what you're putting into this thing. 
      
   B) Config.xml :
      The idea here is that the ConfigParser is going to parse out all the little 
      bits for the various classes. There will be several classes that only hold 
      information about the setup (paths/etc) and about the experiment (number 
      of bars, solid angle coverage, beta efficiency, etc.).
