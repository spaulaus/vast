\subsection{General Update}
I have let this thing sit there idle for quite a while. I am going to start 
updating this and getting things more reasonable in terms of its useability, 
and the different aspects of the code. 

\subsection{Documentation with Doxygen}
The first thing on the plate to start documenting all of the various methods, 
classes, and things of that nature. I also need to setup the list of 
dependences and in general get a working setup/usage model going.
